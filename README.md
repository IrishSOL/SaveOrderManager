Just a nice little mod that lets you save your carts into a file so you can easily just reload them whenever ordering more products.
Known issues:
- Save Popup doesn't have a cancel button. (Plan to fix later, for now just hit [ESC])
- If your cart is filled already, it won't let you load. (This is because I couldn't figure out how to reset the cart and was tired 
of trying, I'm sure if I took 5 or 6 hours out of my day I'd get it eventually but I feel like this QOL mod will eventually be obsolete 
with future patches due to the dev eventually realizing this is an important feature that should be in base game)
- Only works with the West (Adding the Central Gas Station and the phone shops soon).
